# Search Starling Transactions

Easily search Starling bank account payments by any string.

E.g. "ACME,2022" will search for the word "ACME" and "2022" inclusive. Search is case-sensitive.


> The online Starling bank only permits searching the name in the transaction, not the amount. This makes it
possible to search transactions by any string (similar to freetext search). Very basic but saves a lot of time for a bookeeper.
