# Search Starling Transactions

Easily search Starling bank account payments by any string.

E.g. "ACME,2022" will search for the word "ACME" and "2022" inclusive. Search is case-sensitive.


> The online Starling bank only permits searching the name in the transaction, not the amount. This makes it
possible to search transactions by any string (similar to freetext search). Very basic but saves a lot of time for a bookeeper.

## What problem does this solve?

As a bookeeper, when a transaction is hard to find, the Starling online banking search is not flexible enough to search for transactions by different values. This wastes a lot of time. Sometimes customers pay multiple invoices in one payment and other discrepancies, so a faster more fine grained search makes it faster to keep bookeeping acruate and correct.
